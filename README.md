# FrontEnd exercise:
Firstly, I started creating a react project using create-react-app. Then, I started following the instructions by creating the component and writing something just to make sure everything was working as expected. Secondly, I started with the Fibonacci sequence, translating the formula into code. Then, once the function was printing the correct given index, it was time to connect it with the input's value. Lastly, when the button is clicked and the function is called, it has to print the correct value. I did it by saving in a variable the empty div element and modifying its value with the result of the function.

# BackEnd exercise

I started thinking how I could compare two numbers in an array without nesting loops. I remembered that using the Array Prototype Some could do this jobs perfectly because it stops the loop once it returns true. So firstly, I started creating three variables to store the information we will be working with. Then, I started loopin the array and checking in a variable the value of the current number we are checking. I created an if statement that will stop the loop by returning true if it finds one pair that when added, it match the target value. If there is not a match, it will keep looping and checking all numbers until the array ends returning at the end undefined, which means there is no solution.
