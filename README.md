# FrontEnd exercise:
Firstly, I started creating a react project using create-react-app. Then, I started following the instructions by creating the component and writing something just to make sure everything was working as expected. Secondly, I started with the Fibonacci sequence, translating the formula into code. Then, once the function was printing the correct given index, it was time to connect it with the input's value. Lastly, when the button is clicked and the function is called, it has to print the correct value. I did it by saving in a variable the empty div element and modifying its value with the result of the function.
